// I know that this is a cheap hack, but what can I do?

// It works since the n in the first vector definitions isn't a macro, but in the other definitions it becomes a macro,
// making each function a definition for a template specialization
// And yes, template specializations require new definitions and old ones CANNOT be used. Don't ask me why.
